The Web is just a small part of the Internet.</p>\n<h2>So What's the Difference?</h2>\n<p>The World-Wide-Web (which is actually read faster than WWW) and the Internet are two different technologies that work togeather to help share information and connect people all around the world but what's the difference between them? I will answer that now. But first a little introduction about both of them.</p>\n<h3>Internet</h3>\n<p>The Internet is a network of billions of computers, servers and other devices that uses internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) the communicate with each other.Internet makes information sharing possible in many forms like WorldWideWeb, hyptertext documents and Email service etc.</p>\n<p>Internet was born as an experiment by US Military under the name of ARPAnet. It was an experiemnt for finding ways to communicate with other computers to use as a Military Communication System in case of any Nuclear Attack. Later the ARPAnet was used in the academic purposes where it connected the network of universites conducting research to make sharing information possible. As personal computers became accessible in the 80s and 90s, the use of internet skyrocketted.</p>\n<p>The Internet is not controlled by just one entity or organization just like it is not an invention of just one person or just one organization but it is the contribution of countless people and organizations that shaped the internet as we know it today.</p>\n<h3>World-Wide-Web (WWW)</h3>\n<p>World Wide Web or simply Web is a small part of the Internet. It is an information system where documents known as web-pages are accessible through URLs (which i explained on <a href=\"/day-20/\">Day20</a>). The Web uses Protocols to communicate over the internet to share information. The HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protcol) is used by web-browsers to access web-pages which may contain documents, images or videos etc.\r\nThe Web is two decades younger than the internet and is actually invented by a single person in 1989 at CERN (a century after the Nintendo founded or the birth of Adolf Hitler) but later the web became public and came into academic and commerical use and started entering into everday life and many websites started publishing content and the web became what we know it today.</p>\n<h3>Difference</h3>\n<p>It's simple the Internet is this <code>-----</code> and the Web which is a part of the internet is this <code>---</code></p>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>💻 Porgramming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Internet vs Web - Some sources leran more about the hostory of the Internet and the Web.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\">Internet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-the-internet-and-the-web-2483335\">Internet vs Web</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>GatsbyJS Routing and Pages - For making Pages for posts that share the same tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🗾 Langauge[<span lang=\"ja\">日本語</span>]</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>時代</strong> (じだい)</span> Period. <span lang=\"ja\">時</span>: Time, <spna lang=\"ja\">代</span>: Substitute.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>社会</strong> (しゃかい)</span>　 Society. <span lan=\"ja\">社</span>:　 Comany, <span lan=\"ja\">会</span>:　 Meet.
